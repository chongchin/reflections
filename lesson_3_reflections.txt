When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	1) So that the code is available to others
	2) Acts as a backup also

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	1) Because I could be working on code that has first to be consistent with my local repository, 
	before considering changes made by others
   
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    1) Fork is used to copy a repository in GitHub to another (user)repository in GitHub only. I will used it to copy another person's
	   repository in GitHub to mine. This is also noted in the orignal user's respository
	2 Clones is used copy a repository from GitHub to local repository or to another (user ) repository in GitHub. I will use 
      to copy a repository from  GitHub to my local respository	
	3) Branches are deviations from the master branch. I will use it if I wish to make experimental changes without affecting
	   main branch.
