When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
1) So that the code is available to others
2) Acts as a backup also

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1) Because I could be working on code that has first to be consistent with my local repository, 
   before considering changes made by others
